## Conflicts Resolved

### üîπ Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Port mismatch ‚Äî production (8080) vs dev (3000)
- **Resolution**: Unified config with environment-based logic
- **Strategy**: Kept production default, added dev override
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Database host and SSL differences
- **Resolution**: Added JSON structure for both environments
- **Strategy**: Supported multiple DB profiles
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Conflicting deployment methods
- **Resolution**: Added `DEPLOY_ENV` condition
- **Strategy**: Dynamic deployment flow
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different log formats and intervals
- **Resolution**: Used `process.env.NODE_ENV` for control
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Separate architecture descriptions
- **Resolution**: Combined both into one document
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different versions and features
- **Resolution**: Combined both with clear environment labeling
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### üîπ Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Experimental configuration missing in main
- **Resolution**: Added ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù profile with AI scaling logic
- **Strategy**: Extended config to handle `production`, `dev`, and `experimental`
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Conflicting DB authentication methods
- **Resolution**: Added `authMethod` parameter and unified structure
- **Strategy**: Merged both connection logics safely
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different pipelines (production vs simulator)
- **Resolution**: Created hybrid deployment script with simulation mode
- **Strategy**: Used conditional branching to select pipeline
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different alert and metric thresholds
- **Resolution**: Created modular configuration
- **Strategy**: Used JSON-based threshold configuration
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Overlapping sections
- **Resolution**: Combined both and clarified simulator section
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Outdated simulator features
- **Resolution**: Merged new simulator documentation
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

## üß† Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers** ‚Äî Learning how `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` represent conflicting branches.  
2. **Choosing Correct Code** ‚Äî Needed to carefully merge logic instead of overwriting it.  
3. **deploy.sh Merge** ‚Äî Contained complex scripts; required testing to confirm both pipelines worked.  
4. **git reflog Recovery** ‚Äî Helped restore a lost commit after accidental reset.  
5. **Rebase vs Merge Confusion** ‚Äî Learned when to rebase vs when to merge for history clarity.

## üìò Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Resolved complex merge conflicts  
- Used rebase, cherry-pick, and reflog effectively  
- Learned soft/mixed/hard reset differences  
- Understood branch workflows deeply  

### Best Practices
- Commit small, logical changes  
- Always run tests after merging  
- Use `git status` and `git diff` before every commit  
- Maintain clear, meaningful commit messages  

### Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal and manageable  
- Reading both sides of the diff is crucial  
- Reflog is a lifesaver for recovery  
- Document every resolution decision

## üí¨ Reflection

This Git Mastery Challenge was a deep dive into real-world version control scenarios.  
I learned how to manage conflicting branches, recover lost commits, and cleanly merge codebases.  
The exercise transformed my understanding of Git from basic usage to professional-level problem-solving.  
Now, I feel confident resolving conflicts and managing branches in large collaborative projects.
